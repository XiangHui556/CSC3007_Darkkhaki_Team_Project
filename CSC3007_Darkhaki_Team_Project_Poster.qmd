# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly transformed numerous industries,
and the food and beverage sector is no exception. One of the most
notable developments during this period has been the rapid growth of
virtual kitchens, also known as ghost kitchens or cloud kitchens, along
with traditional restaurants that have expanded their services to
include online ordering options. These innovative culinary ventures have
gained significant traction, reshaping the landscape of food service in
unprecedented ways.

Virtual restaurants in this context means that the restaurant is only
available for pickup/delivery and there’s no dine in option. They are
“ghost restaurants”, there is no place to walk up to, no signage, no
seating. These restaurants operate out of commercial warehouses or
trailers. And people usually patronize these virtual restaurants through
delivery apps due to the restaurant names, and attractive images.[^1]

The significance of both virtual kitchens extends beyond mere
convenience. They represent a fundamental shift in how food is produced,
marketed, and consumed. These models offer increased flexibility and
efficiency, allowing restaurateurs to minimize overhead costs associated
with physical dining spaces while maximizing their reach through digital
platforms. For consumers, the ease of access to a diverse range of
cuisines from the comfort of their homes has revolutionized dining
habits and preferences.

In this project, we aim to aim to improve the previous visualizations
and provide a comprehensive overview of how virtual kitchens have
expanded across various states. This transformation encourages both
consumers and restaurateurs to adapt to and embrace these innovative
approaches, paving the way for a more dynamic and resilient food service
landscape.

# Previous Visualization

```{r}
#| label: fig-percentage-of-virtual-restaurants-in-a-city
#| fig-cap: "Percentage of restaurant listings in a city."
#| out-width: 95%

include_graphics("images/Virtual_restaurants_near_you.png")
```

# Strengths

-   The visualization is simple and straightforward to understand.
-   It shows the top 12 cities with the highest percentage increase of
    virtual restaurants, which allows the reader to understand the
    cities that are in popularity for these virtual restaurants.
-   Based on the data, you can really see the huge boom in popularity of
    virtual restaurants over the years.

# Suggested Improvements

1.  *Add a plot title and a source note* so that figure 2 can be
    understood in isolation (e.g., when shared on social media).
2.  *Identify missing data.* The data should cover all cities in the
    United States or in figure 1, all the years.
3.  *Having consistency in labels.* Consistency in data annotation (the
    percentage) can help readers understand the visualization more
    easily.
4.  *Adding a legend.* A legend can help readers understand the
    visualization more easily while reducing misinterpretation of the
    visualisation.
5.  *Include statistics for every state.* Statistics will help readers
    get an overview of the virtual restaurants across the country .
6.  *Using a choropleth map.* A choropleth map can help readers
    visualize the distribution of restaurants in different states more
    effectively.

# Implementation

## Data

-   The data used in this visualisation was obtained from Kaggle [^2] and GitHub [^3],
    that was scraped from Uber Eats[^4]. The datasets contains
    information on the number of restaurants and important data such as
    name, full address, lat, long.

[^3]: <https://github.com/gsunit/Extreme-Uber-Eats-Scraping/blob/master/1.5M-Uber-Eats-Restaurants.zip>

[^4]: <https://www.ubereats.com>

-   The data was cleaned and transformed to extract the state
    abbreviation and the year partnered.

## Software

We used the Quarto publication framework and the R programming language,
along with the following third-party packages:

-   *dplyr* for data manipulation
-   *tidyverse* for data transformation, including *ggplot2* for
    visualization based on the grammar of graphics
-   *usmap* for plotting the US map
-   *scales* for formatting the scales of the plot
-   *sf* for spatial data manipulation
-   *ggtext* for formatting text in the plot
-   *stringr* for string manipulation
-   *knitr* for dynamic document generation

# Improved Visualization

```{r}
#| label: fig-percentage-increase-of-restaurants-in-US
#| fig-cap: "Percentage increase of virtual kitchens in the United States."
#| out-width: 100%

include_graphics("images/Percentage-increase-of-restaurants-in-US.png")
```

# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

Due to the intention of the visualisation to be used in a poster, there
are no interactive elements. However, if the visualisation were to be
used in a digital format, the following interactive elements could be
added:

1.  *Hover-over information*: When hovering over a state, the user can
    see the number of virtual kitchens in that state.
2.  *Filtering*: Users can filter the data by year to see how the number
    of virtual kitchens has changed over time.
3.  *Zooming*: Users can zoom in on a specific region to see the number
    of virtual kitchens in more detail.
4.  *Search*: Users can search for a specific state to see the number of
    virtual kitchens in that state.

# Conclusion

We have implemented the suggested improvements to the visualization. By
using a choropleth map, it ensures that the data is much more easily understood
as readers can identify areas with a higher percentage of virtual
kitchens and get an overview of the distribution of virtual kitchens.
