# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed numerous industries, and the food
and beverage sector is no exception. One of the most notable
developments during this period has been the rapid growth of virtual
kitchens, also known as ghost kitchens or cloud kitchens. These
innovative culinary ventures have gained significant traction, reshaping
the landscape of food service.

Virtual kitchens are commercial cooking facilities that prepare food
solely for delivery or takeout, without the traditional dine-in option.
Unlike conventional restaurants, virtual kitchens often operate multiple
brands or menus from a single location, optimizing efficiency and
catering to diverse consumer preferences. This model leverages modern
technology, including advanced logistics and digital platforms, to
streamline operations and enhance customer experience.

# Strengths

-   The visualisations used in the article are clear and easy to
    understand.

# Suggested Improvements

1.  *Add a plot title and a source note* so that the figure can be
    understood in isolation (e.g., when shared on social media).
2.  *Include statistics every state.* Statistics will help readers get
    an overview of the virtual restaurants in each state and understand
    the data better.
3.  *Use a discrete color palette.* Continuous palettes can make it
    challenging for humans to detect patterns below just noticeable
    color differences.
4.  *Using a heatmap.* A heatmap can help readers identify patterns in
    the data more easily.

# Implementation

## Data

-   

## Software

We used the Quarto publication framework and the R programming language,
along with the following third-party packages:

-   *readxl* for data import
-   *tidyverse* for data transformation, including *ggplot2* for
    visualization based on the grammar of graphics
-   *knitr* for dynamic document generation
