# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed numerous industries, and the food
and beverage sector is no exception. One of the most notable
developments during this period has been the rapid growth of virtual
kitchens, also known as ghost kitchens or cloud kitchens, along with
traditional restaurants that have added online ordering options. These
innovative culinary ventures have gained significant traction, reshaping
the landscape of food service.

Virtual restaurants in this context means that the restaurant is only
available for pickup/delivery and there’s no dine in option. They are
“ghost restaurants”, there is no place to walk up to, no signage, no
seating. These restaurants operate out of commercial warehouses or
trailers. And people usually patronize these virtual restaurants through
delivery apps due to the restaurant names, and attractive images.[^1]

On the other hand, many traditional restaurants have adapted by
integrating online ordering systems, allowing customers to place orders
through their websites, mobile apps, or third-party delivery platforms.
This hybrid model offers both online and offline ordering capabilities,
expanding their reach and providing greater convenience to their
customers.

The significance of both virtual kitchens and traditional restaurants
with online ordering extends beyond mere convenience. They represent a
fundamental shift in how food is produced and consumed. In this project,
we aim to improve the previous visualizations and provide a
comprehensive overview of how virtual kitchens and
online-ordering-enabled restaurants have expanded across various states.
This transformation of the food industry encourages consumers and
restaurateurs to adapt to and embrace these new models.

# Previous Visualization

# Strengths

-   The visualisation is clear and easy to understand.
-   The visualisation also highlights the top 12 cities with the highest
    percentage of virtual restaurants.

# Suggested Improvements

1.  *Add a plot title and a source note* so that the figure can be
    understood in isolation (e.g., when shared on social media).
2.  *Identify missing data.* Identifying missing data can help readers
    understand the limitations of the visualization.
3.  *Adding a legend.* A legend can help readers understand the
    visualization more easily.
4.  *Include statistics for every state.* Statistics will help readers
    get an overview of the virtual restaurants in each state.
5.  *Using a heatmap.* A heatmap can help readers visualize the
    distribution of virtual restaurants in different states more
    effectively.

# Implementation

## Data

-   The data used in this visualisation was obtained from Kaggle [^uber_eats_usa_data], that was scraped from Uber Eats[^uber_eats]. The dataset contains information on the number of restaurants and important data such as name, full address, lat, long.

- However, for the purposes of the visualisation, since there was no data available for the inception of virtual kitchens in each state, we have randomly generated data for the years 2019 to 2023.

[^uber_eats]: <https://www.ubereats.com>

## Software

We used the Quarto publication framework and the R programming language,
along with the following third-party packages:

-   *readxl* for data import
-   *tidyverse* for data transformation, including *ggplot2* for
    visualization based on the grammar of graphics
-   *knitr* for dynamic document generation

# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

Due to the intention of the visualisation to be used in a poster, there are no interactive elements. However, if the visualisation were to be used in a digital format, the following interactive elements could be added:

1.  *Hover-over information*: When hovering over a state, the user can see the number of virtual kitchens in that state.
2.  *Filtering*: Users can filter the data by year to see how the number of virtual kitchens has changed over time.
3.  *Zooming*: Users can zoom in on a specific region to see the number of virtual kitchens in more detail.
4.  *Search*: Users can search for a specific state to see the number of virtual kitchens in that state.

# Conclusion

We have implemented the suggested improvements to the visualization. By
using a heatmap, it ensures that the data is much more easily understood
as readers can identify areas with a higher percentage of virtual
kitchens and get an overview of the distribution of virtual kitchens.
