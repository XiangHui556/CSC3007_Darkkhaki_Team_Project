# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed numerous industries, and the food
and beverage sector is no exception. One of the most notable
developments during this period has been the rapid growth of virtual
kitchens, also known as ghost kitchens or cloud kitchens. These
innovative culinary ventures have gained significant traction, reshaping
the landscape of food service.

Virtual restaurants in this context means that the restaurant is only
available for pickup/delivery and there’s no dine in option. They are
“ghost restaurants”, there is no place to walk up to, no signage, no
seating. These restaurants operate out of commercial warehouses or
trailers. And people usually patronize these virtual restaurants through
delivery apps due to the restaurant names, and attractive images.[^1]

The significance of virtual kitchens extends beyond mere convenience.
They represent a fundamental shift in how food is produced and consumed.
In this project, we aim to improve the previous visualizations and
provide a comprehensive overview on how virtual kitchens have expanded
across the various states and transform the food industry, encouraging
consumers and restaurateurs to adapt to and embrace this new model.

# Previous Visualization

```{r}
#| label: fig-number-of-virtual-restaurants
#| fig-cap: "Number of virtual restaurants listed on Uber Eats from 2019 to 2023."
#| out-width: 100%

include_graphics("images/Explosion_of_virtual_restaurants.png")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-percentage-of-virtual-restaurants-in-a-city
#| fig-cap: "Percentage of restaurant listings in a city."
#| out-width: 90%

include_graphics("images/Virtual_restaurants_near_you.png")
```

# Strengths

-   The visualisation used in the article emphasises the increase in the
    number of virtual restaurants listed on Uber Eats from 2019 to 2023.
-   The visualisation also highlights the top 12 cities with the highest
    percentage of virtual restaurants.

# Suggested Improvements

1.  *Add a plot title and a source note* so that the figure can be
    understood in isolation (e.g., when shared on social media).
2.  *Identify missing data.* Identifying missing data can help readers
    understand the limitations of the visualization.
3.  *Adding a legend.* A legend can help readers understand the
    visualization more easily.
4.  *Include statistics for every state.* Statistics will help readers
    get an overview of the virtual restaurants in each state.
5.  *Using a heatmap.* A heatmap can help readers visualize the
    distribution of virtual restaurants in different states more
    effectively.
6.  *Having a mulitple heatmaps.* Multiple heatmaps can help readers
    compare the number of virtual restaurant over the years.

# Implementation

## Data

-   

## Software

We used the Quarto publication framework and the R programming language,
along with the following third-party packages:

-   *readxl* for data import
-   *tidyverse* for data transformation, including *ggplot2* for
    visualization based on the grammar of graphics
-   *knitr* for dynamic document generation

# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

# Conclusion

We have implemented the suggested improvements to the visualization. By
using a heatmap, it ensures that the data is much more easily understood
as readers can identify areas with a higher percentage of virtual
kitchens and get an overview of the distribution of virtual kitchens.
